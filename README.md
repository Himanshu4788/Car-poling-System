# Car-poling-System


🚘 Carpooling System

A smart and scalable ride-sharing web application that matches passengers and drivers efficiently based on location and route similarity.
Built with Node.js, Express, EJS, and Java, this project demonstrates distributed system concepts, clustering algorithms, and secure backend design.

🔹 Features

🔄 Smart Ride Allocation: Implemented K-Means clustering, TSP, and Genetic Algorithm to optimize driver–rider matching (up to 50–60% efficiency gain).

🔐 Secure Authentication & Authorization: Role-based access with encrypted sessions.

🧩 Modular Architecture: Designed for scalability, fault tolerance, and code maintainability.

⚙️ Robust Validation & Error Handling: Ensured data integrity and consistent API responses.

🌐 Real-Time UI Updates: Dynamic interface built using EJS templates with live route tracking simulation.
